## Project Overview
This project enhances medical diagnostic accuracy by developing a deep learning model that detects cervical fractures from vertebral images. Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the EfficientNet architecture in TensorFlow and integrating YOLOv5 for object detection, this model achieves high accuracy and is a valuable tool for medical professionals.

## Features
- **EfficientNet Architecture**: Implements a CNN using EfficientNet to achieve a 95.2% classification accuracy rate for vertebral images.
- **YOLOv5 Object Detection**: Integrates YOLOv5 to advance fracture detection capabilities, attaining an 86% accuracy rate.
- **Deep Learning in Medical Image Analysis**: Utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency of cervical fracture detection.
